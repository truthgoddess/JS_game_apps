# JS_game_apps
These is a collection of my front end code for various games and apps. 

I developed many of these as part of my training on FreeCodeCamp. Any advice or feedback is appreciated.  

You can use this to preview the files: https://htmlpreview.github.io/

If the program isn't working properly there, try it on http://www.katernorton.com/programming

Have a great day!
